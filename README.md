# **Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning**

Here I have build a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. This project is done in Python. In this project, I used Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.

***
## **Work flow**

**Before Training**

Diabetic Data --> Data pre processing --> Train Test Split -->  Support Vector Machine Classifier.

**After Training**

New Data --> Trained Support Vector Machine Classifier --> Diabetic (or) Non-   Diabetic ~ predicition.
